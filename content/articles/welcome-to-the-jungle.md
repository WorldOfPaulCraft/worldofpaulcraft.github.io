## New Blog, Who Dis?

I know, I know: it’s 2023, why the _hell_ don't I have a blog yet?

To be fair, I've been pretty busy. I've:

- Been a software engineer now for nearly a decade,
- Worked at multiple pre-Series C startups,
- Done a couple year stint at a large, public tech company,

and, now, I've got some stuff to figure out.

Luckily, writing is a good way to figure stuff out, and if anybody else
actually reads this, maybe some other people can benefit from it, as well.

## So, what's this thing all about?

Truthfully? I have no idea. The subtitle, "The blog of one random software
engineer and his random interests," I think, pretty much conveys where I think
I'll be going with this for the immediate future.

Luckily, my interests are many and varied, so I don't think I'll run out of
things to say anytime soon. Besides technology, software, engineering, and
those sorts of things, I have a pretty strong academic bent as well. So,
definitely look forward to seeing some posts here and there that have
equations and diagrams in them. My background is in math, so math, computer
science, and those sorts of things are definitely on the menu.

Along those lines, I should probably warn you, I use Emacs, and I think Lisp
is cool. I'd count on at least a post or 3 here here and there about Emacs
and/or Lisp. If you want to skip those, it's okay; I won't be offended. But, I
will say, you're missing out if you do.

## Okay. I get it. It's one of those nerdy "tech blogs," right?

Well, not entirely. You know how I mentioned my "many and varied" interests?
You might be hearing about them at some point. I talk entirely too much about
my dog, enjoy playing tabletop role-playing games, and, once in a while,
something interesting even happens in my life.

Right now, I also happen to have a good bit of time on my hands, so I may be
working on this site with some regularity. For now, expect regular changes
(hopefully improvements!) and updates.

## Cool. Let's do it.
